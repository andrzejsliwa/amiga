Custom made Amiga Workbench Theme for the CD32

16 colors
(and Copper Deamon for the window gradients)

This is the palette:

The font is XEN (from MUI)
The icons are saved as NewIcons

Although it's possible to run this in a 16 color WorkBench, it's recommended to use at least a 32 color screenmode.
That way you can also set the MUI colors and have some pens left for other programs.

Color Locker and Border Blanker recommended!

Workflow:
 - First made in Photoshop
 - color-reduced with (the super awesome) http://tool.anides.de/
 - cleaned up and re-dithered back in Photoshop
 - icons cut out and saved with Personal Paint on the Amiga
